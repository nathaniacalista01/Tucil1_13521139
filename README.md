## **General Description** 

24 Card Game is a game where all players do arithmethic operations to 4 cards that was selected by a moderator or by one of the players until all those cards can reach number 24. Arithmethic operations that can be used are simple operators like addition, substraction, multiplication, and division. Moreover, players are allowed to use all variations of parentheses to reach 24. This progam is designed to help people to solve the 24 card game within a short ammount of time. 

## **Program's Requirement**
